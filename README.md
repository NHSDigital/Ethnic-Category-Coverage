# Background
Ethnicity is of particular interest in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic therefore NHS Digital created an ethnic category information asset that combines data from general practice and hospital episode statistics (HES); combining these sources increases coverage. This Management Information (MI) which aims to inform users of the quality, coverage, and distribution of ethnic category recording within the ethnic category information asset.

The 2011 Census published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), is the gold standard for ethnicity recording in England and Wales, however as this data is nearly 10 years old and may no longer reflect the ethnic breakdown of the current population NHS Digital have amalgamated ethnic category data from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and GPES Data for Pandemic Planning and Research COVID (GDPPR-COVID) to provide a near population (England only) level view of ethnic category. The use of the underlying dataset is limited to COVID planning and research purposes due to the legal basis under which the data is collected.

## Publication 

Previously this MI was published every fortnight adding a new xls file to the zip file to reflect the most recent GDPPR reporting period end date. Following a consultation period finishing in August 2022, the MI was published every quarter (January, April, July and October) in the same format as before. April 2024 is the last published update of this data and there are no plans for any future publications.

The MI is published here: https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mi-ethnic-category-coverage/current
